## Intro
MIPS is a game I made with 5 other people as part of a team project during my second year at university. 

## Game Concept
MIPS is a  game is inspired on the 1980s arcade game PacMan. The main difference being that both the main character – mipsman – and the other ghouls are user playable. 
Branching off from the original, when a ghoul catches mipsman they kill them, taking their place as the new reigning mipsman. 
Meanwhile, the old mipsman is killed, respawns elsewhere on the map as ghoul and now has to try and recapture the new mipsman.

Sabotage is encouraged through powerups and traps and incentivised with rewards, live leader boards, and specialist awards after the game times out.

The game modernises the user experience of classic arcade games with a sleek isometric viewpoint, yet blocky pixelated fonts and retro 8bit music & sound effects.
